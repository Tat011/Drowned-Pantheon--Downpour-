Brief Summary:

Room Name: DP_LE03
Category: Light LightExterior
No. of Screens : 9
Water: Yes
Open Sky: Yes
Construction: Two towers standing in water

Entrances: Pipes 0 and 1 are the two entrances to the room. 
	Pipe 0 opens to the middle right (into the top left corner of the shorter tower); suitable to lead to the upper part of a two-screen vertical/interior room
	Pipe 1 opens to the bottom left (into the water at the base of the taller tower); suitable to lead to an underwater base or near-surface room

Other Pipes: 
	Pipes 2 and 3 are above-water dragon dens in the taller tower. Suitable for wall/background-climbing creatures.
	Pipes 4 and 5 are underwater dragon dens in the stretch of water between the two towers. Suitable for leeches, snails, kelp, salamanders, etc.  
	All other entrances are sky enrances that can spawn vultures. Water is not deep enough for Leviathans.

Miscellaneous information:
	1. The room is a designated SWARMROOM and has batfly hives. Migration may need to be controlled.
	2. Lizards that can climb poles can potentially exit the room from Pipe 0 as well. Lizards that cannot swim should not go down Pipe 1 if it is made to connect to an underwater room.
	3. The room is not suitable for Scavengers or Green Lizards. Greens may be trapped.
	4. There are two whack-a-mole holes in the tall tower and two more in the water.
	5. There is a collectible for a blue token halfay down the outer wall of the taller tower. Requires jumping off the top and sliding down the wall, or a spear or two from the botom to access.
	   (this token has been set to Cyan Lizard as a default, but it may be set for another creature to suit the spawns of the room/region better if Cyan Lizards are not included in the room.)
