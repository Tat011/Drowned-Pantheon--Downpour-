- Ideally this room would be close to the top of the structure, so the light shining down makes sense. 
- The room's designed to be on the edge of the cliff face (you can only see outside     through the right windows, the left ones are inside)
- There are two pipe connections in the left corridor, one under the bridge thingy and one in the right corridor, feel free to use whatever ones are necessary
