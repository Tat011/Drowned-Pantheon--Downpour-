Hello there, curious slugcat!
Looks like you're lost in the Drowned Pantheon mod's files. Well done!

Here you will find a big pile of many red screens and settings, 
all of which are required for this region mod to work.

But to all of you modders or people who don't bother playing the game, 
you might be wondering: "What are these Architect.txt files for?"

Let me explain the story behind them.


It was a long time ago, when in #modding-gallery a new message appeared,
asking people to join a "Community Region Project".

People joined, discussed about its theme, and then started making their own levels.
When a level was done, it could be submitted along with an optional
"Architect.txt" text file which had some additional instructions for the region architects.

Despite that absolutely genius plan, the whole region turned out very disorganized,
and eventually it got abandoned.


2 years later, few months after the slightly more organized Arid Barrens region jam was finished,
we decided it was time to revive the very first region jam. The Drowned Pantheon.

And now, even though many of the levels have been modifed or completely redesigned,
the ancient "Architect.txt" texts are a remnant of what those levels used to be.
You can read them to see what the original intent of those levels were.


...Unless we have decided to remove the architect texts,
in which case please remove this text file as well or this would be embarrassing.


Thank for reading, I guess.

P.S. If you're curious as what Drowned Pantheon was like back then, here's a download link to an old copy of it:
